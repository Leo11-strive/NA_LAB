# NA Labs    
## One of the best labs I've ever done. Only C is allowed(or numpy can be used). Codes of each lab is relatively short. Yet they demonstrate the essence of computing. My answers are full score. To be mentioned, testing inputs change every semester, so the iterative loops may need to be adjusted.
